Title: New Blog
Tags: pelican, python, blog

Ok, this is my attempt to create a new blog using [github](github.io) pages, [Pelican](http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.6.3/), [Travis](). I used to have a quite old fashioned blog [mikrohelen.net](http://mikrohelen.net), which I haven't touched for ages. So, I wanted to move on. I'm using heavily github so I found it an appealing option. I also develop in Python and I wanted a familiar framework to work with for blogging. After a bit of research I ended up following the tutorials from [cyrille.rossant.net](http://cyrille.rossant.net/pelican-github/) and [crunk.io](http://crunk.io/post/introduction-to-pelican/). 

## Step 1: Create a github repository based on your github username
This is for setting up the website. Follow the steps from [https://pages.github.com/]. Mine is in [https://github.com/elenimikro/elenimikro.github.io]

## Step 2: Clone the repo and Setup Pelican 
First clone the repo in your machine
```shell
$ git clone git@github.com:username/username.github.io.git
```
Then setup Pelican in the local folder - It's better to use a clean environment to do that using [virtualenvs](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/)
 ```shell
$ pip install pelican
$ pip install pelican-markdown
```

follow the 

# Step 3: Configure pelican 
Some things from my configurations:

#Step 4: Build with Travis 


## Things To Do
This is quite primitive yet. I need to setup DISQUS and get cracking with some more content.
